DCS-BBN is a Decentralized Cloud System based on Blockchian Networking. This is Pyhton developed code for the system.

  - Completely backed by Blockchain works on advanced Algorithms
  - Developed in Pyhton Language with Flask Framework
  - Deployed within local system 
  - Need ERC-20 Contracts and Ethereum test networks for inter-platform transfer

# New Features!

  - Completely Decentralized system gives no single point of failure 
  - Enhaced Security and Cost Effective Ecosystem
  - Multiple ways for data transfer, higher retrival speeds with basic plans 
  - Allows connectivity and chance to convert DCScoin with any big blockchian coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Mine Crypto currency with your non redundent storage capacity and allow other user to save their data on to you space.
  - Work with the future technology in the cloud systems.


### Tech

DCS-BBN uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Flask Framework](https://github.com/pallets/flask) - Lightweight and Fast!
* [Python-Pypi](https://pypi.org/) - Best to install remotore packages and virtual enviornment.
* [Blockchain](https://github.com/blockchain) - The future of Computing.
* [Pycrypto](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto) - Compilation of Best in class algorithms.
* [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - Conveying HTTP and HTTPS requests to backend 
* [Picle & Json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) - files used in development - completely encrypted
* [Tensorflow, Tflearn & Numpy](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/) - The Artificial Intelligence Part.


And of course DCS-BBN itself is open source with a [public repository ](https://www.dcs-bbn.com/) on GitHub.
