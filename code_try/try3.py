'''here the code and program is same as bchai try copy 1
but we arent giving the first element directly into list instesd 
we are adding last_transaction in add_value to have more better versatility of the code
now here we can give last_tansaction a kind of default value which is [1]

#this is also true but we can do it very easily
add_value(2,[1])
add_value(0.9,get_last_blockchain_value())
add_value(10.80,get_last_blockchain_value())

#now what if we take transaction ammount from the user to create next block of the blockchain
tx_ammount = float(input('Please Enter Your Transaction Ammount: '))
